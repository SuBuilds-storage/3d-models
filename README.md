# 3D Models Repository

This repository contains free 3D models that I’ve created using various 3D software and tools.

**About**

All models in this repository are either:  
• **Untextured**  
• **Vertex-colored**  
• **Fully textured** with PBR materials (mostly in 1K or 2K resolution)  

As a **Roblox developer**, most of the models are optimized accordingly.

**Download & File Formats**

All models are uploaded in `.fbx` format only and are linked to my **Sketchfab profile**, where you can:  
• Download the models for free  
• Get them in different formats via Sketchfab's conversion tools  
• Preview them in real-time  

**Note:** This repository only stores links and basic information. The actual downloads happen through Sketchfab.

**Licensing**

**All licensing details are provided on Sketchfab for each model.**  
Be sure to check them before using the assets in your own projects.
