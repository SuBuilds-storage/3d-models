# 3d-models
This repo is used to store free 3d models. 

This repo stores all my models i create with any 3d software or app. The models can be untextured or just colored, but can also have pbr materials applied. It mostly will be 1k or 2k as i am a roblox developer. *All models are linked to my sketchfab*, where you can download it. This allows me more and easier control, but also for you, such as getting a converted format *as i only upload in fbx*.

**THE LICENCING IS WITHIN SKETCHFAB, SO BE AWARE**
